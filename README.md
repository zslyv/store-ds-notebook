# Store Data Notebook

## Goal

Assess the performance of four retail locations by examining:

- Overall revenue generated by each store  
- Differences in customer ratings and shipping expenses  
- Sales performance by product category and individual items  
- Regional sales distribution across four zones: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast  
- Strategic recommendations to enhance efficiency and determine if one store should be sold  

### Main Insight

**Store 4** has the **lowest revenue** at **$1,038,375,700.00** and a **very limited presence in the Northeast region (0.4%)**. Based on these factors, it is **advised to consider selling this store**.
